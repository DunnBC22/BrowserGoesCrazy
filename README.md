# BrowserGoesCrazy

I found the following video on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDRhsqi7jOg) and thought I would try it myself. It was a fun (and short) warm up exercise before I jumped into more difficult tasks.

This script automatically picks a random site from the list that I provided and opens it in a new browser tab once every 3 to 20 seconds. Again, the iteration of the loop is randomly selected within the range of 3 to 20 seconds.
